Installing Editors on Windows

Editor is the part where we write the code.
Notebook and pen we have pen to represent items and paper where we output the code.

Something to write,something to run Terminal is used for running the program
Atom is preferrable for simplicity
Anaconda 
Pycharm

Installing python
Download python from https://www.python.org/
Check ADD Python 3.7 to PATH
Install Now

Check by running Command Prompt on Windows and just type python 
">>>" represents the python shell & its ready to take python commands & code.
if you want to come out of shell just type exit().

You can perform simple calculations in shell like 3+5,print("hello world")

Why don't on Notepad ??
We can write but we have efficient text editor and by typing in Notepad its more time consuming process.

Here we are using Atom
https://atom.io/
or
setup provided in the resources folder

Editor is a place where we write code and run at the same place why we called it efficient.
