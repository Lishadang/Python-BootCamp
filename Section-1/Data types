Data types
data is different in every case.
like for writing we need paper
  for eating we need food
  
  sentence we need words.
  calculation we need numbers.
  to find out datatype use type()
  
Variables and Constants
variable is a container for storing data 
for groceries we need container
x=5
x is a container(variable)
Constants-can't change
Non-constants(variable)-can change

1. Numbers
  Operations on Numbers
  Associativity & Precedence
  +, -, /, *, power Arithmetic operators
  
  Dynamic typing- if we have specified data type cannot store on another datatype its an advantage in python
  Casting- changing datatype from one to another we can declare explicitly in which datatype we need output

2. Strings-" " set of characters water
  anything that perform particular task, instead of writing again &again-method or function 
  lower()
  dir("string")
  Indexing & slicing- x[3],x[::-1],x.replace('1','3')
  Formatting- arranging things in order .format() default,positional,keyword 
  
3. List-[] collection data types
  ["red","blue","green","yellow",3,4.3]
  dir(list),len(x),pop(),append(),remove("yellow"),del(x)[whole x deleted]
 
4. Tuples-() elements of tuple cannot change else same as list
  dir(tuple)
  
5. Dictionary-{} keys:values
  {"number":1, "name":"Blue", "age": 23}
  dir(list),x["year"]=2021,x.pop("age")
  
6. Boolean- true false
  5<6,4<5
